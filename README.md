# Moonrise App

This is a Moonrise App to provide a user Moonrise times after dark, based on their zip code.

In theory, a signed in user could then create Google Calender events for these moonrises in their OWN calendar, using the "add to calendar" button.

In reality, the "add to calendar" button will create events in MY google calendar only.
