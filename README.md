# Moonrise App

This is a Moonrise App. When given a zip code, the app will provide a user with Moonrise times for the next 60 days that fall after sunset and before moonrise.

Ideally, once signed in via a google account, a user could then create Google Calender events for these moonrises in their OWN calendar, using the "add to calendar" button.

In reality, the "add to calendar" button will create events in MY google calendar only (which is why this site will be yanked off the internet promptly after it's graded). Multiuser calendar functionality will have to be a future endeavor (thanks for being understanding, Dr. Toal)!

# Credits

I relied heavily on Scott McCartney's [Firebase Cloud functions tutorial](https://medium.com/zero-equals-false/integrating-firebase-cloud-functions-with-google-calendar-api-9a5ac042e869) to get set up with Firebase functions and for the code for the addEvent() firebase function.

I also used Dr. Toal's [Blog Starter Code](https://github.com/lmucs/blog-starter-app) as a starting point for this app.
